# Advent of Code 2023 (Rust edition)

This project splits each day of advent of code into individual workspaces named `d01` to `d25`. Input resides as plain-text files under the `input/` directory. Running the base project will provide the answers for both parts of each day. Running tests on the workspaces will test against the example input and expected output.
